1.0.5   fixed parsing of %ENV values for mail output

1.0.4   screwed up parsing of %ENV, apparently.

1.0.3	removed real mail test unless you explicitly set env params

1.0.1	improvements to testing, should build under windoze.
		can use environment vars FB_FMP_SMTP and FB_FMP_EMAIL
		as the smtp and email arguments.
